Middle Manager should exploit this capability:\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n1. User describes their goal in natural language ('I want to sell my house')\n2. AI enters planning mode to decompose into tasks\n3. For each task, AI determines:\n   - Execution type (human/AI/hybrid)\n   - Likely duration estimate (optional, based on typical scenarios)\n   - Confidence level in its ability to help\n   - What validation/checkpoints are needed\n\nPLANNING MODE BENEFITS:\n- AI can reason about the FULL plan before suggesting individual tasks\n- Better dependency prediction (sees the whole picture)\n- Can identify tasks that MUST be human (legal, financial, physical)\n- Can suggest where AI can provide maximum value\n\nVALIDATION CHECKPOINTS:\n- After AI generates plan: 'Does this look right? Missing anything?'\n- Before major milestones: 'Ready to proceed to [next phase]?'\n- When AI completes automated tasks: 'AI completed X. Please review before continuing.'\n\nThis exploits the strength of AI planning while keeping humans in control.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:36:31.324663-08:00","created_by":"derrickburns","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:36:31.324663-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"beads-for-humans-0ji","depends_on_id":"beads-for-humans-reh","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:36:36.427633-08:00","created_by":"derrickburns"}]}
